Sonarqube Github Integration

DevOps Platform integrations allow SonarQube to interact with your DevOps Platform. This enables things like authentication, or providing analysis details and a Quality Gate to your Pull Requests directly in your DevOps Platform's interface.


Pre-requisites

Set Server base URL in Administration > Configuration > General Settings > General.

Import your GitHub repositories to SonarQube. 

This is a 3 step process
1. Create your GitHub App.
2. Install your GitHub App in your organization.
3. Update your SonarQube global settings with your GitHub App information.

Github Actions

This can integrate analysis into build pipeline

Steps:
1. Create your GitHub Secrets. 

a. Sonar Token: Generate a SonarQube token and, in GitHub, create a new repository secret in GitHub with SONAR_TOKEN as the Name and the token you generated as the Value.
b. Sonar Host URL: In GitHub, create a new repository secret with SONAR_HOST_URL as the Name and your SonarQube server URL as the Value.
c. SONAR_ROOT_CERT - Holds an additional root certificate (in PEM format) that is used to validate the SonarQube server certificate. You can set the SONAR_ROOT_CERT environment variable in the "Secrets" settings page of your repository, or you can add them at the level of your GitHub organization (recommended).

2. Configuring your .github/workflows/build.yml file


It is possible to fail a github check if quality gate check fails. 



Limitations in Community edition: 

1. Inability to see the quality gates and code metrics from Github itself. 
2. Inability to automatically detect branches or PRs. They have to be explicitly mentioned as parameters in the workflow file. 
3. Can only analyze the main branch
4. Can integrate with only one Github account
5. Community Edition doesn't support analyzing multiple branches with Github actions.
